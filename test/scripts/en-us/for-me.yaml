    There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 from spreading. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Here's what you can do to protect yourself:

    Clean your hands often
    â€¢ Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
    â€¢ Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
    
    
    Avoid close contact
    â€¢ Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community.
    â€¢ The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Maintain a distance of 6 feet or more from other people.

    Even if you are not sick:
    â€¢ You should stay home unless you are an essential worker, or if you cannot stay home.
    â€¢ Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze. Use a tissue or the inside of your elbow.
    â€¢Â Throw used tissues in the trash.
    â€¢ Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
    â€¢ If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
    â€¢ You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask).
    â€¢ Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.
